# Physic ThesisKirkwood-Gaps

In this repository you can find some books, the code and the presentation that I did in order to study the Kirkwood Gaps.

You should start reading the [TFG Movimiento de asteroides en las Zanjas de Kirkwood.pdf.](https://github.com/Mazziitoozz/Physic-Thesis-Kirkwood-Gaps/blob/master/TFG%20Movimiento%20de%20asteroides%20en%20las%20Zanjas%20de%20Kirkwood.pdf)
